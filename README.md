# socialMediaApp

This is a fully functioned social media app that has some features like messaging, friends, video chat, purchasing items, sharing stuff and so on.
used; android studio, JAVA(backend), XML(frontend), firebase(database)...
Yet, 
this is not the working version of the app. Thousands of codes here and thousands and thousands of code on original file.

I destructed the code. I wanted to add this project to my portfolio, so i changed the code and shared it. 


If you want to have an idea about how i code android please dive in.
